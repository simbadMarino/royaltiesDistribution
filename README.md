## **Simple royalties distribution example**

### tronide deployment instructions

1. Delete default workspace and create your own in tronide.io.
2. Delete tests folder and all other files under the "contracts" folder.
3. Create a new empty RoyaltiesDistribution.sol file. TRON-IDE Interface should look like this: <img width="776" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a16a9a8-46e5-4e6a-a620-7b5fc246c1bc">

4. Copy the Solidity code from https://github.com/simbadMarino/royaltiesDistribution/blob/main/tronbox/contracts/RoyaltiesDistribution.sol and paste into tronide created file.
5. Save file by Ctrl+S(Win or Linux) or Cmd+S(mac). If a compiler issue appears on the pragma code line make sure to switch to the correct solidity version (0.8.20) under the compiler section.

### tronbox deployment instructions
1. git clone this repo
2. Create a .env file for your private key
   You have to select your desired network depending on where do you want to deploy your contract.
   1. Use `export PRIVATE_KEY_NILE= "Your private key here without quotes" `for nile testnet
   2. Use `export PRIVATE_KEY_SHASTA= "Your private key here without quotes" `for shasta testnet
   3. Use `export PRIVATE_KEY_MAINNET= "Your private key here without quotes"``` for mainnet deployment (this will cost you real TRX so be cautios here)
3. Compile the code:` tronbox compile`
4. Deploy your contract: `source .env && tronbox migrate --network nile ` (Example for nile testnet, you can use shasta or mainnet instead in the network argument
